# Excel_Retail_Store_Analysis
Interactive Excel Dashboard Project for Data Analytics.
This project is designed as a foundational data analytics project that demonstrates end-to-end workflow skills using Microsoft Excel — from raw data preprocessing to building an interactive dashboard.

The project begins with **data preprocessing in Excel**, where raw data is cleaned and structured for analysis. This includes removing duplicates, handling missing values, correcting inconsistent entries, formatting data types, and creating calculated fields using formulas and conditional functions. These steps ensure the dataset is reliable and analysis-ready.

Next, **Pivot Tables** are used to aggregate and summarize the data across key dimensions, helping uncover trends, distributions, and performance indicators. Based on these summaries, multiple **Pivot Charts** are created to visually represent insights through bar charts, line charts, and pie charts.

All visualizations are then combined into a single dashboard sheet. **Slicers and interactive filters** are connected across Pivot Tables and charts so that selections dynamically update every visualization simultaneously. This transforms the report into a fully **interactive Excel dashboard** that supports quick exploration and decision-making.

This project is well-suited as a **starting project in data analytics**, as it demonstrates core analytical competencies: data cleaning, transformation, summarization, visualization, and dashboard design — all using industry-standard Excel tools.
